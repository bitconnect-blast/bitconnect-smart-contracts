Seems that something is wrong with addresses generated for the pairs, such that this:

    // calculates the CREATE2 address for a pair without making any external calls
    function pairFor(address factory, address tokenA, address tokenB) internal pure returns (address pair) {
        (address token0, address token1) = sortTokens(tokenA, tokenB);
        pair = address(uint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(
                hex'ff',
                factory,
                keccak256(abi.encodePacked(token0, token1)),
                hex'2b5acc383999dcfa23ff3ca28ff40fe2a348c05ac6a425d6fdfea4b09aa4aa01' // init code hash (update for each deployment)
            ))));
    }

Doesn't know the right pair addresses
